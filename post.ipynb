    "Over the past year or so, I've been using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io) extensively for my research, and I've also been encouraging other astronomers to give it a try.\n",
    "In particular, I've been using JAX as the computation engine for probabilistic inference tasks.\n",
    "There's more to it, but one way that I like to think about JAX is as NumPy with just-in-time compilation and [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation).\n",
    "The just-in-time compilation features of JAX can be used to speed up you NumPy computations by removing some Python overhead and by executing it on your GPU.\n",
    "Then, automatic differentiation can be used to efficiently compute the derivatives of your code with respect to its input parameters.\n",
    "These derivatives can substantially improve the performance of numerical inference methods (like maximum likelihood or Markov chain Monte Carlo) and for other tasks such as Fisher information analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post isn't meant to be a comprehensive introduction to JAX (take a look at [the excellent JAX docs](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) for more of that) or to automatic differentiation ([I've written some words](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/tutorials/autodiff/) about that, and [so have many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=automatic+differentiation)), but rather an introduction to the JAX ecosystem for probabilistic inference, with some examples that will be familiar to astronomers.\n",
    "From my perspective, one benefit of the JAX ecosystem compared to other similar tools available in Python (e.g. [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io), [Stan](https://mc-stan.org), etc.) is that it's generally more modular.\n",
    "In practice, this means that you can (relatively) easily combine different JAX libraries to develop your preferred workflow.\n",
    "For example, you can build a probabilistic model using [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai) that uses [tinygp](https://tinygp.readthedocs.io) for Gaussian Processes, and then run a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using [BlackJAX](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, however, I'll focus primarily on providing an introduction to [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai), which is a probabilistic programming library that provides an interface for defining probabilistic models and running inference algorithms.\n",
    "At this point, NumPyro is probably the most mature JAX-based probabilistic programming library, and [its documentation page](https://num.pyro.ai) has a lot of examples, but I've found that these docs are not that user-friendly for my collaborators, so I wanted to provide a different perspective.\n",
    "In the following sections, I'll present two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first example is a fairly simple linear regression problem that introduces some basic NumPyro concepts. In the second half of this example, we will re-implement the model from [my \"Mixture Models\" post](https://dfm.io/posts/mixture-models/) to account for outliers in the simulated dataset, while also introducing some more advanced elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second example is an astronomy-specific problem that is designed to really highlight the power of these methods. In this example, we will measure the distance to the [M67 open cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_67) using a huge hierarchical model for parallaxes measured by [the Gaia Mission](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia) for stars in the direction of M67. This example includes running an MCMC sampler with thousands of parameters, which would be intractable with the tools commonly used by astronomers, but only takes a few minutes to run using NumPyro.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Linear regression with outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll use NumPyro to fit a linear regression model to the data simulated in [my \"Mixture models\" post](https://dfm.io/posts/mixture-models/).\n",
    "This simulated dataset has some outliers so, as we'll see below, simple linear regression isn't going to work very well, so we'll extend the model to include a mixture as presented in the aforementioned blog post.\n",

    "\n",
    "In astronomy, we often want to measure distances (to stars, galaxies, etc.), but this is actually quite a difficult measurement to make in general.\n",
    "One approach for measuring distances to \"nearby\" stars is to use the [observed parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax), the apparent shift in position of a star (relative to some reference frame) as our observing angle changes (e.g. as the Earth orbits the Sun).\n",
    "[The Gaia Mission](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia) is a European Space Agency mission that is currently measuring the parallaxes of millions of stars in our Galaxy, and we can use these measurements to infer the distances to these stars.\n",
    "In this tutorial we will look into making such measurements using NumPyro.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in too deep, I should emphasize that I'm very much not an expert in this field (I just thought it was cool example to try!), so even though I've tried to do/say sensible things here, there may be details that I've missed from the astrophysics perspective.\n",
    "Furthermore, the final model in this section, while pretty rad, isn't necessarily the best model for measuring the distance to M67 using Gaia, and if you want to use this in production, you may want to include other measurements like proper motion.\n",
    "If you do see any issues, please let me know by [opening an issue on the GitHub repo for this post](https://github.com/dfm-io/post--intro-to-numpyro/issues), or by emailing me!\n",

    "A common practice in this field is to use a probabilistic model for the parallax measurements with a sensible prior on the distance to more robustly propagate the measurement uncertainty to the distance constraint.\n",
    "[Bailer-Jones (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02105) and other subsequent publications advocate for the following prior on the distance $r$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $L$ is a length scale parameter that will depend on the sky position of the target, and possibly other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this prior in NumPyro, we need to figure out how to specify it using the existing `Distribution` objects, or by implementing a custom distribution.\n",
    "When I first started writing this post I couldn't figure out how to sample from this prior, but then I realized that it's just a [chi-squared distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution) with 6 degrees of freedom.\n",
    "More explicitly, if some variable $u$ is distributed as a chi-squared distribution with 6 degrees of freedom, then $r = u \\times L / 2$ is distributed following the distribution above.\n",
